# The Ethical Implications of the Five-Stage Skill-Acquisition Model
_H Dreyfus, S Dreyfus_
---

TBH I really did not like this paper. It uses "phenomenologically" entirely too often, and to me I felt it contradicted itself in many places--though maybe that was just because it kept quoting certain writers who were writing about other philosophers and didn't do it well. If you have read this paper and can help me better understand it, please reach out!

The paper outlines a five-stage model of how we generally acquire skills:
1. Novice
2. Advanced Beginner
3. Competence
4. Proficiency
5. Expertise

Basically it seems to say that those at the "expertise" level _just know_ the right way to do things (based on years and years and many hours of experience). So those at the top level of ethics also _just know_ the right way to do things, and we should just let them tell us. With no explanation, because offering explanations are akin to rules, which are only for novices or advanced beginners. To me, this just reeks of status designation, that only experts should have any say in rule-making, and stakeholders should just listen and trust them.

I may just not like the underlying assumptions or messages, but I also found the writing to be difficult to parse.
