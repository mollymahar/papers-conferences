# Free Speech in the Algorithmic Society: Big Data, Private Governance, and New School Speech Regulation

_Side note: I loved this paper and thought it was really well-written and insightful on the topic. If you're interested in the topic of free speech on the internet, I highly recommend you read it._

Main idea: This paper explores the current state of speech regulation on the internet, how it's different from typical 1st Amendment regulation, what problems those differences bring, and what new obligations we might want to place on tech platforms regarding speech.

> The problems of free speech in any era are shaped by the communications technology availabile for people to use and by the ways that people actually use that technology.

The 1st Amendment guards against state censorship, but courts shouldn't interpret it to mean that they cannot regulate infrsatructure companies for the purpose of protecting the ability for individuals to participate in the public sphere.
> Thus, the state, while always remaining a threat to free expression, also needs to serve as a necessary counterweight to developing technologies of private control and surveillance.

Our practical ability to speak is governed today by infrastructure companies (ISPs, social media, etc), and so nation-states have figured out that they just have to go after the infrastructure companies in order to have those companies regulate speech on the nation-state's behalf. This is "New School" speech regulation (as opposed to old school speech regulation, which focused directly on speakers and publishers of content).

Our rights of free expression are simultaneously challenged by companies that try to use 1st Amendment arguments inappropriately to defend their power to surveil and control populations, as well as private governance and new school speech regulation.

Draws a distinction between *distributed* and *democratic* power.

Data about people is a method of governance and control:
> Debates about robots and artificial intelligence tend to center on whether robots and AI agents themselves are dangerous, whether they will break free from human control, assert themselves, take over the world, and cast humans aside. This is the trope of the Frankenstein monster, or Skynet in the Terminator movies. This way of thinking deflects our attention from what is actually the most important issue. *The question is not the robots; it is the people and companies behind the robots that we should be concerned with*. [emphasis mine]

Two areas where regulation is legal:
1. information fiduciaries (Fiduciary relationships involve asymmetries of power with sensitive information, like with doctors and lawyers. Balkin is not recommending the same level of regulation with tech companies, merely pointing out that the concept is not new.)
2. algorithmic nuisance (Companies are externalizing the socially unjustified costs of algorithmic decision-making onto the populations whose lives are shaped by these cascading and contextless decisions, by having their opportunities constricted. An activity becomes a nuisance because the defendant engages in *too much* of the activity.) **Though I'm not clear what remedy he is espousing here--he doesn't ever mention something specific**

New School speech regulation has three features:
1. Collateral censorship
	- When the state aims at A in order to control B's speech (when A and B are different entities, e.g. one is a person and one is a social media publisher).
	- *Ex ante* methods of speech regulation include filtering and blocking. *Ex post* methods involve takedown, with or without notice to the speaker.
	- Reminiscent of digital prior restraint (when decisions are made by bureaucrats without an opportunity to be heard and without civil liberties and other procedural protections). Speech is restricted until the bureaucrat (or programmer) gets around to giving permission.
2. Public/private cooperation or cooptation
	- Over time, many infrastructure companies have to devote significant time to these pressures, in all parts of the world, often with differing requests (which then might be meshed into one response to ease the burden on the infrastructure company...or that is a feared outcome, at least).
3. Private governance
	- Infrastructure company gets to make its own rules about who gets to speak, when, how, and about what
	- Stems from telecom law, from property rights, and from T&Cs with end users

From a *dyadic* model (state vs. speaker/publisher) to a *pluralist* model (state vs. infrastructure provider vs. end user/speaker/citizen). also, end users can be governed by more than one infrastructure provider (remember Wikileaks being taken down by CC processing companies, who just closed off access to money?). Groups can also use a variety of ways to silence speakers (harassment, discipline, confusion, etc).

In New School system, due process becomes MUCH more important.
> For many participants, procedural values may be as important if not more important than substantive values.
> These obligations include procedural fairness in handling complaints and applying sanctions, notice, transparency, reasoned explanations, consistency, and conformity to rule of law values--the "law" in this case being publicly stated norms and policies of the company.

> ...as online speech platforms govern, and increasingly resemble governments, it is hardly surprising that end-users expect them to abide by the basic obligations of those who govern populations in democratic societies. These expectations include (1) obligations of transparency, notice, and fair procedures; (2) the offer of reasoned explanations for decisions or changes of policy; (3) the ability of end-users to complain about the conduct of the institution and demand reforms; and (4) the ability of end-users to participate, even in the most limited ways, in the governance of the institution.

And then the paper moves into briefly talking about the Right to be Forgotten, highlighting that
> Currently the internet is mostly governed by the values of the least censorious regime--that of the United States. If nation states can enforce global filtering, blocking, and delinking, the Internet will eventually be governed by the most consorious regime. This will undermine the global public good of a free Internet.

Balkin calls for these infrastructure companies to revise their vision of themselves, and accept that they are a new kind of media company.
