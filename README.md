As a designer of intelligent systems, I consider a wide range of topics to be relevant to my work and try to stay up to date on them. This repo contains notes and/or summaries for research or technical papers that I've read and conferences I've attended. They're arranged broadly by category and then by publication date. The links direct to my notes, unless I haven't yet written them up.

Contents:

- [Conferences](#conferences)
- [Ethics & Policy](#ethics-and-policy)
- [Machine Learning and NLP](#machine-learning-and-nlp)
- [Conversation Design](#conversation-design)
